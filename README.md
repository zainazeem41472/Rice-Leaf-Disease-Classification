# Rice-Leaf-Disease-Classification
## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on the **multi-class classification of rice leaf images** using deep learning. 
Given an input image, the system classifies it into one of several rice leaf disease categories or identifies it as a non-leaf image. 
The aim is to support early disease diagnosis by accurately categorizing rice leaf conditions using a custom CNN model.
## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform multi-class classification of rice leaf images
- Identify specific rice leaf diseases from input images
- Classify images as leaf or non-leaf
- Improve classification accuracy using data augmentation
- Develop a robust CNN-based classification model
## 🦠 Classification Classes
The model performs **image classification** into the following classes:
- Bacterial Leaf Blight  
- Brown Spot  
- Leaf Blast  
- Leaf Scald  
- Narrow Brown Spot  
- Healthy Leaf  
- Not Leaf (irrelevant images such as humans, chairs, pens, etc.)
## 🧠 Model Architecture
A **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** was designed and trained from scratch for **multi-class image classification**.
The architecture consists of convolutional layers for feature extraction and fully connected layers for final class prediction.
